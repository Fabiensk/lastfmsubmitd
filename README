LastMP and lastfmsubmitd
========================

LastMP is an MPD client that will detect when you play a song that is
valid to submit to Last.fm. It will poll every 5 seconds by default. To
change this, use the --sleep option. Upon detecting a valid song, it
will invoke lastfmsubmit.

lastfmsubmit will take the song specified on the command line with
--artist, --title, --length, and optionally --album and --mbid, and
encode it in UTF-8 (pseudo-)YAML. Then, it will write it to
lastfmsubmitd's FIFO or the file specified by --output. The primary
purpose of this program is to abstract character encoding and
(pseudo-)YAML document creation; all your player plugin needs to do is
detect a song and invoke lastfmsubmit. Of course, you can also run it
manually should something go wonky.

lastfmsubmitd connects to Last.fm with the user and password specified
with --user and --password (as this option the exposes password to ps,
it is recommended you use it for testing only), or in the environment
variables LASTFM_USER and LASTFM_PASSWORD. It then reads
(pseudo-)YAML-formatted submissions from its FIFO and submits them, or
caches them if submission is not possible due to network or server
errors. Handling of network errors is relatively flakey at the moment,
so keep an eye on your log file.

Replaying tracks from a CD
==========================

If you frequently play music on a home or car stereo system that is not
connected to your computer, you may still wish to submit these songs to
Last.fm. lastcd will read the CD in your computer's CD-ROM drive, query
MusicBrainz for its album information, and output it in (pseudo-)YAML.
This format is like the one lastfmsubmitd uses, but it does not contain
the time of submission. Instead of reading from the CD-ROM drive, you
can also specify an album with --discid or --albumid. If a list of track
numbers is also specified, only those tracks will be printed.

If you are really lazy and don't want to put the CD in, you can use
mbfindalbum, specify the album name with --album, and chose the album's
MBID from that. (You can also try specifying --artist, but at the moment
it does not really work and cannot be used in combination with --album.)

lastcdreplay will take a list of songs encoded in this format, add
submission times to them as if they had all just been played in order,
and write them to lastfmsubit's FIFO or the file specified by --output.

Daemon Usage
============

lastfmsubmitd uses /var/run/lastfmsubmitd/fifo for IPC and
/var/cache/lastfmsubmitd/subs to save uncommitted submissions between
runs. I would recommend creating "lastfmsubmitd" and "lastmp" user
accounts and putting them in a "lastfm" group, with the FIFO
group-writable. If you plan on using lastcdreplay from your normal user
account, add that account to the "lastfm" group as well.

Requirements
============

LastMP requires py-libmpdclient2, available from
http://incise.org/index.cgi/py-libmpdclient2.

Caveats
=======

The pseudo-YAML format most of these programs use may deviate from the
published spec, as I simply whipped up some prototype code myself. I
plan to switch to the Python bindings for Syck as soon as I get a chance
to port the documentation into a Python-friendly format. At that point
any other program will be able to use a conformant YAML implementation
to generate input for lastfmsubmitd.
