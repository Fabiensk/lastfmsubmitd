0.4 (2005-12-xx):
=================

* Added a --new-hook option to lastmp. This will be run whenever a new
  song is detected (%s for the song info).

0.3 (2005-12-11):
=================

* Fixed an import error in lastcdreplay that prevented it from running.

* You can now specify --device in lastcd.

0.2 (2005-12-08):
=================

* Make lastmp call lastfmsubmitd with a correct path, rather than
  looking for it in the current directory. This will make submissions
  work again.

* Output V/A CDs correctly in lastcd.

0.1 (2005-12-08):
=================

* Initial release.
