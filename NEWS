  * Fix the order of fork/setsid and pidfile creation. (thanks Nick Welch)

  * Make running from a user account's $HOME really work. The default
    directory for this is now ``~/.lastfmsubmitd``, which contains at least
    ``conf`` and ``spool``. (I would ordinarily be loath to change this in a
    "stable" release, but it didn't really work at all before because there
    was not a defined standard for the spool. Thanks also to Nick Welch for
    pointing this out.)

1.0.1 (2008-09-24)
==================

  * Split everything besides the daemon and example client into its
    own package (ears). Unrelated players can now depend on us, and
    distributions can package us, without dragging in things they may not
    want (MusicBrainz, cdparanoia).

  * Moved lastmp to a "contrib" subdirectory to emphasize the fact that
    this package is not just for MPD; only the 250 lines of our flagship
    example are.

  * Fixed a possible crash when lastfmsubmitd is fed malformed YAML.

0.37 (2008-01-07)
=================

  * Close file descriptors, etc, when daemonizing.

  * Add missing import in client.py.

0.36 (2007-10-27)
=================

  * Client interface has totally changed (see README.plugins). All problems
    regarding spool path etc. not being honored should be fixed.

  * Write pidfile even if --no-daemon, so we don't crash. Unnecessary, but
    easier for now.

  * Read sleep time correctly in config.

  * Fix sox error in peel -c.

  * Fix peelrc [options] section parsing.

  * Add --encoder option in peel.

0.35 (2007-03-29)
=================

  * Fix crash when a buggy MPD reports the length of a track as zero.

0.34 (2007-03-26)
=================

  * Sort submissions by time if several spool files are read in one go, to
    avoid erroneously triggering the spam filter (thanks to Steve Hill and
    a cast of thousands).

  * Suppress extra warnings if lastmp cannot connect to MPD.

  * Fixed creation of Unicode filenames, songs with slashes, and -d option
    parsing in peel. Also, actually install it.

0.33 (2006-07-31)
=================

  * Improved some documentation.

  * If there is no account information set, print a warning and exit
    normally, instead of panicking. (Reported by Joey Hess.)

0.32 (2006-07-08)
=================

  * Added peel, a simple CD ripper for use with mbget which pipes audio
    data to another command (e.g. bfp) and submits played tracks while
    encoding in the background.

  * Added a --print-discid option to mbget so that CDs that have been
    extracted somewhere without network access can be tagged and encoded
    by peel later.

  * Re-added some lost data validation in lastfmsubmitd.

  * Fix lastmp's handling of bad passwords (MPD will let us connect, but
    not actually return any useful information since we don't have read
    permission).

  * Make enabling debug from the config file actually work.

0.31 (2006-06-23)
=================

  * Replace the environment/option nonsense with a config file.

  * Make logs group-writable again.

  * Fix a timeout crash in lastfmsubmitd.

0.30 (2006-05-31)
=================

  * Use a spool directory for both the "cache" and reading new subs from
    plugins; no more locks, blocking, or possibly losing stuck submissions
    when restarting the daemon. If you are upgrading, you must move
    /var/cache/lastfm to /var/spool/lastfm.

  * Removed lastfm.queue and lastfm.logger modules; everything is in
    lastfm (with simpler function names) or lastfm.marshaller. Non-Python
    writers should use mkstemp and print normally; there is no more need
    to fork.

  * Replaced all --output options with --stdout.

  * Updated a bunch of documentation.

0.29 (2006-05-06)
=================

  * Fixed pesky GC error message that would appear when cleaning up after
    a failed attempt to grab the lock.

  * Added a bunch of --help, and improved error messages.

  * Fix some decoding calls in lastfmsubmit that weren't updated when
    things were reorganized.

0.28 (2006-04-18)
=================

  * Recover correctly if a lastmp forked proccess fails.

  * Log untagged files with the filename instead of None, and make a guess
    at the encoding if MPD breaks it somehow. This should fix a crash with
    certain files.

0.27 (2006-04-12)
=================

  * Skip bad data rather than attempting to log it and causing errors.

  * Install lastfmsubmit in /usr/lib/lastfmsubmitd, and use the Python
    queue-writer interface in lastmp instead.

  * Check for a supplied submission time in lastfmsubmitd.

0.26 (2006-03-25)
=================

  * Fix logging error when creating fifo.

0.25 (2006-03-24)
=================

  * Added some documentation for plugin developers. Hoping to go 1.0 soon.

  * Don't create lockfiles with --output; instead use /var/run/lastfm/lock
    but only if we are writing to the fifo. WARNING: I decided this was a
    good excuse to change the lastfm.queue.Writer interface while I still
    can, so if you are using that, please change your init args.

0.24 (2006-03-13)
=================

  * When printing to a pipe in mbfind or mbget, encode with the locale's
    default encoding instead of corrupting everything into ascii.

  * Added a --no-network option to lastfmsubmitd for testing purposes, and
    fixed the --no-daemon option.

  * Work around a bug in urllib's error handling that was causing crashes.

0.23 (2006-02-26)
=================

  * Make mbfind not print a template unless --template is specified;
    otherwise, it will fail, so that ``mbget || mbsubmit`` works as you
    would expect.

  * Clean up error messages and add some for import errors in the
    MusicBrainz stuff.

  * Ignore songs with missing data properly; this is the daemon's job now,
    so you don't have to worry about throwing crap at it from your client.
    (Your client should not know anything about the network protocol.)

0.22 (2006-02-23)
=================

  * Fix possible truncating of song titles due to stringification. This is
    another brown paper bag fix, isn't it. Today is not my day.

0.21 (2006-02-23)
=================

  * Brown paper bag: fix man page install locations.

0.20 (2006-02-23)
=================

  * Wrote man pages.

  * Convert everything to unicode before serializing. Unfortunately, this
    includes track numbers, but those only exist to make the output easier
    to read. If we need them for something we'll do real number parsing.

0.19 (2006-02-23)
=================

  * If mbfind or mbget are printing to a pipe, replace non-ascii values
    rather than raising an error.

  * Quote all string values when serializing, so as to be more compatible
    with real YAML implementations.

  * If we crash for any reason, write it to the log. Make debug logging a
    bit more useful in general and regular logging perhaps a bit less
    annoying.

0.18 (2006-02-06)
=================

  * Gratuitously renamed all the "other" programs. For consistency with
    lastmp, the thing that takes a log and sends it to the daemon is now
    named lastcd. The thing that used to be lastcd, which only fetches
    data from MusicBrainz and is not Last.fm-specific, is now named mbget.
    For consistency with that, mbfindalbum is now simply named mbfind. And
    for symmetry with those two, I have added mbsubmit, which assists in
    sending disc IDs to MusicBrainz.

  * Added a --freedb option to mbget, which fakes a CDDB-format listing
    suitable for use with abcde or other CD-ripping programs which use
    FreeDB.

  * If lastmp starts when a song is after 4:00 but not at 50%, assume it
    was already submitted at 4:00 and don't submit it again.

  * Rather than replacing invalid data in lastfmsubmit, try UTF-8 and then
    the locale encoding (this can still be overridden with --encoding). If
    neither work, abort rather than sending something corrupted.

0.17 (2006-01-30)
=================

  * Got rid of the old install. The new way of doing things is: One
    user/group lastfm:lastfm, everything in /var/{log,run,cache}/lastfm
    (which must be created by root), we own and always fix permissions of
    files in those directories. Put better instructions for this in
    INSTALL, install-example.sh, and init-example.sh. If you have an
    existing setup, please change it! It will no longer be compatable with
    the Debian package.

  * The daemons now fork into the background by default. Added a
    --no-daemon option to prevent this.

  * Replaced the asyaml format with a simple marshaller module that uses a
    format much closer to a simple YAML map. It should now be trivial to
    use libsyck (once it is working properly, and once pysyck is updated
    and packaged) as a drop-in replacement.

  * Reading from the fifo should be a bit saner about catching multiple
    writers, and will always wait until there are none before continuing.

  * Don't let the exponential backoff keep growing if it becomes longer
    than 6 hours.

  * Added an --encoding option to lastfmsubmit. If not specified, the
    locale's default will still be used. If invalid data is given, it will
    be replaced rather than causing an error.

  * Provide some nicer error messages if the log file cannot be opened
    for writing.

0.16 (2006-01-19)
=================

  * Use a proper alarm-based timeout on HTTP connections to the server, so
    that it doesn't matter what implementation of urllib we have.

  * Add --debug to lastcdreplay.

0.15 (2006-01-08)
=================

  * Take setup.py back out of install.sh. This doesn't work if you need to
    set any options such as --prefix, so it's not very useful.

  * Change musicbrainz.queries to just musicbrainz as the python bindings
    decided to move things around for no good reason. Version 2.1.2 or
    later is now required if you want to use any of the MB stuff.

0.14 (2006-01-08)
=================

  * Log untagged files as errors.

  * Work around some mpdclient2 breakage that was causing lastmp to crash
    on any song missing one or more pieces of metadata.

0.13 (2006-01-07)
=================

  * Brown paper bag fix: mpdclient2 sucks, and we need to convert
    crossfade time to an int.

0.12 (2006-01-07)
=================

  * Don't mark new songs as skipped if crossfade is on.

  * In install.sh, set up directory permissions and run setup.py.

0.11 (2006-01-06)
=================

  * Reset throttle only when we successfully handshake or submit, so that
    we actually back off exponentially.

  * Set the default timeout for socket in an attempt to make urllib behave
    nicer. I believe this does not work under 2.4, but it's something.

  * If there are multiple writers waiting (for example, upon startup or
    after a long network timeout), read from all of them and wait until
    there is nothing left before submitting.

0.10 (2006-01-04)
=================

  * Added setup.py and install.sh so that installation should be
    relatively painless. setup.py does the actual installing; install.sh
    merely sets up users and permissions.

  * Improve the handling of an empty or nonexistent cache.

0.9 (2006-01-03)
================

  * Some small fixes in how we handle rejected submissions and other
    FAILED responses.

  * Make log messages more user-friendly and less redundant if debugging
    is off.

0.8 (2006-01-02)
================

  * Brown paper bag fix: submit the oldest cached subs first, not the
    newest. Yikes!

0.7 (2006-01-02)
================

  * Redesign the main loop so that we can increase the network backoff
    exponentially without forcing lastfmsubmit to block until we succeed.
    Instead, just sleep for 15 seconds or so at a time and check if we're
    ready to try the network again. This will keep the fifo from clogging
    up, so we can read it only once per loop without worrying about
    falling behind.

  * Don't log debugging information by default. If you want to turn it on,
    use --debug.

0.6 (2006-01-01)
================

  * Lock the fifo, with /var/run/lastfm/fifo.lock. Any program that needs
    to write to the fifo must use this.

  * Catch SIGTERM and clean up/save the cache properly.

0.5 (2005-12-31)
================

  * Improve handling of untagged songs in lastmp.

  * Catch handshake errors properly and back off until we can connect.

0.4 (2005-12-14)
================

  * You can now specify standard output as "-" in lastfmsubmit and
    lastcdreplay.

  * Error handling should be improved.

0.3 (2005-12-11)
================

  * Fixed an import error in lastcdreplay that prevented it from running.

  * You can now specify --device in lastcd.

0.2 (2005-12-08)
================

  * Make lastmp call lastfmsubmitd with a correct path, rather than
    looking for it in the current directory. This will make submissions
    work again.

  * Output V/A CDs correctly in lastcd.

0.1 (2005-12-08)
================

  * Initial release.
