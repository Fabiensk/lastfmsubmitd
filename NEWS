* Gratuitously renamed all the "other" programs. For consistency with
  lastmp, the thing that takes a log and sends it to the daemon is now
  named lastcd. The thing that used to be lastcd, which only fetches
  data from MusicBrainz and is not Last.fm-specific, is now named mbget.
  For consistency with that, mbfindalbum is now simply named mbfind. And
  for symmetry with those two, I have added mbsubmit, which assists in
  sending disc IDs to MusicBrainz.

* If lastmp starts when a song is after 4:00 but not at 50%, assume it
  was already submitted at 4:00 and don't submit it again.

* Rather than replacing invalid data in lastfmsubmit, try UTF-8 and then
  the locale encoding (this can still be overridden with --encoding). If
  neither work, abort rather than sending something corrupted.

0.17 (2007-01-30):
==================

* Got rid of the old install. The new way of doing things is: One
  user/group lastfm:lastfm, everything in /var/{log,run,cache}/lastfm
  (which must be created by root), we own and always fix permissions of
  files in those directories. Put better instructions for this in
  INSTALL, install-example.sh, and init-example.sh. If you have an
  existing setup, please change it! It will no longer be compatable with
  the Debian package.

* The daemons now fork into the background by default. Added a
  --no-daemon option to prevent this.

* Replaced the asyaml format with a simple marshaller module that uses a
  format much closer to a simple YAML map. It should now be trivial to
  use libsyck (once it is working properly, and once pysyck is updated
  and packaged) as a drop-in replacement.

* Reading from the fifo should be a bit saner about catching multiple
  writers, and will always wait until there are none before continuing.

* Don't let the exponential backoff keep growing if it becomes longer
  than 6 hours.

* Added an --encoding option to lastfmsubmit. If not specified, the
  locale's default will still be used. If invalid data is given, it will
  be replaced rather than causing an error.

* Provide some nicer error messages if the log file cannot be opened
  for writing.

0.16 (2006-01-19):
==================

* Use a proper alarm-based timeout on HTTP connections to the server, so
  that it doesn't matter what implementation of urllib we have.

* Add --debug to lastcdreplay.

0.15 (2006-01-08):
==================

* Take setup.py back out of install.sh. This doesn't work if you need to
  set any options such as --prefix, so it's not very useful.

* Change musicbrainz.queries to just musicbrainz as the python bindings
  decided to move things around for no good reason. Version 2.1.2 or
  later is now required if you want to use any of the MB stuff.

0.14 (2006-01-08):
==================

* Log untagged files as errors.

* Work around some mpdclient2 breakage that was causing lastmp to crash
  on any song missing one or more pieces of metadata.

0.13 (2006-01-07):
==================

* Brown paper bag fix: mpdclient2 sucks, and we need to convert
  crossfade time to an int.

0.12 (2006-01-07):
==================

* Don't mark new songs as skipped if crossfade is on.

* In install.sh, set up directory permissions and run setup.py.

0.11 (2006-01-06):
==================

* Reset throttle only when we successfully handshake or submit, so that
  we actually back off exponentially.

* Set the default timeout for socket in an attempt to make urllib behave
  nicer. I believe this does not work under 2.4, but it's something.

* If there are multiple writers waiting (for example, upon startup or
  after a long network timeout), read from all of them and wait until
  there is nothing left before submitting.

0.10 (2006-01-04):
==================

* Added setup.py and install.sh so that installation should be
  relatively painless. setup.py does the actual installing; install.sh
  merely sets up users and permissions.

* Improve the handling of an empty or nonexistent cache.

0.9 (2006-01-03):
=================

* Some small fixes in how we handle rejected submissions and other
  FAILED responses.

* Make log messages more user-friendly and less redundant if debugging
  is off.

0.8 (2006-01-02):
=================

* Brown paper bag fix: submit the oldest cached subs first, not the
  newest. Yikes!

0.7 (2006-01-02):
=================

* Redesign the main loop so that we can increase the network backoff
  exponentially without forcing lastfmsubmit to block until we succeed.
  Instead, just sleep for 15 seconds or so at a time and check if we're
  ready to try the network again. This will keep the fifo from clogging
  up, so we can read it only once per loop without worrying about
  falling behind.

* Don't log debugging information by default. If you want to turn it on,
  use --debug.

0.6 (2006-01-01):
=================

* Lock the fifo, with /var/run/lastfm/fifo.lock. Any program that needs
  to write to the fifo must use this.

* Catch SIGTERM and clean up/save the cache properly.

0.5 (2005-12-31):
=================

* Improve handling of untagged songs in lastmp.

* Catch handshake errors properly and back off until we can connect.

0.4 (2005-12-14):
=================

* You can now specify standard output as "-" in lastfmsubmit and
  lastcdreplay.

* Error handling should be improved.

0.3 (2005-12-11):
=================

* Fixed an import error in lastcdreplay that prevented it from running.

* You can now specify --device in lastcd.

0.2 (2005-12-08):
=================

* Make lastmp call lastfmsubmitd with a correct path, rather than
  looking for it in the current directory. This will make submissions
  work again.

* Output V/A CDs correctly in lastcd.

0.1 (2005-12-08):
=================

* Initial release.
