Installation
============

Create a file ``/etc/lastmp.conf`` and put in something like:

    [mpd]
    host: localhost
    port: 6600
    password: **********

All Python programs that are also lastfmsubmitd clients will pick up its
configuration, so in most cases you won't need to set anything. If you
do, though, the [daemon] and [paths] sections work the same as they do
there.
