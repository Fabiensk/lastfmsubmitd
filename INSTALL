Installation
============

 1. Run ``./setup.py install`` as usual.

 2. Create a user/group for the daemon(s) (I use lastfm:lastfm), and
    the following directories:

    * ``/var/log/lastfm``
    * ``/var/run/lastfm``
    * ``/var/spool/lastfm``

    Make them writable by whatever user (or group) is going to be running
    the daemon(s) and/or music players. ``doc/install-example.sh`` shows
    how this should be done on most systems.

 3. Create a configuration file, ``/etc/lastfmsubmitd.conf``. This is a
    regular Python ConfigParser file, and should look like::

        [account]
        user: decklin
        password: ********

    It can also optionally contain any of these sections:

        [server]
        url = http://post.audioscrobbler.com/

        [daemon]
        sleep_time: 5
        debug: False

        [paths]
        log: /var/log/lastfm/lastfm.log
        pidfile: /var/run/lastfm/daemon_name.pid
        spool: /var/spool/lastfm
