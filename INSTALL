Installation
============

1. Run ``./setup.py install`` as usual.

2. Create a user/group for the daemon(s) (I use lastfm:lastfm), and
   the following directories:

   * ``/var/log/lastfm``
   * ``/var/run/lastfm``
   * ``/var/cache/lastfm``

   Make them writable by whatever user is going to be running the
   daemon(s). ``install-example.sh`` shows how this should be done on most
   systems.

4. If you need an init script, look at ``init-example.sh``.
